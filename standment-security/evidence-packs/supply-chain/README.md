# Software supply-chain evidence portfolio

**状態: BUILDING**

> このファイルは自動R&Dが作るEvidence骨格。検証結果を捏造せず、実測Evidenceが入るまでVERIFIEDにはしない。

## 目的
Supply-chain assurance evidence pack with repeatable checks and clear pass/fail boundaries.

## 顧客にとっての価値
A customer or reviewer can inspect dependency, code-analysis and build-chain evidence in one place and understand what is checked automatically on each change.

## Evidence Checklist
- [ ] Baseline / before evidence
- [ ] Reproduction steps
- [ ] Defensive change or control
- [ ] Retest / after evidence
- [ ] Negative or counterevidence
- [ ] Limitations / environment assumptions
- [ ] Rollback or failure-handling note
- [ ] Human-inspectable summary

## Research Contract
- Track: `SEC-PORT-003`
- Owned / authorized systems only
- No credentials, exploit payloads, or third-party targets in Senju directives
- Code alone is not verification evidence
- Technical evidence is not market-demand evidence

## Next Build Step
Fill exactly one unchecked evidence item with a reproducible artifact, then rerun the portfolio gate.
